 denmark.1.d:0 "The 45th Eurovision was recently held in Globe Arena in Sweden. The [DEN.GetAdjective] rock/pop duo Olsen Brothers won the contest with their song 'Fly on the Wings of Love' gaining a 40 point lead on Russia, who came second place. This marks the first time [DEN.GetName] has won the contest since 1963 and has sent the entire country into nationwide celebration."

 denmark.2.t:0 "[DEN.GetName] Chooses the Welfare State"
 denmark.2.d:0 "After intense negotiations, a political deal was recently made between several parties in the [DEN.GetAdjective] Parliament with the stated goal of protecting and expanding the [DEN.GetAdjective] welfare state. The welfare state is an internationally renowned part of [From.GetName], but has had very vocal opposition for decades. Political commentators, who had ruled out the possibility of a welfare expansion, are already likening the deal to that of the Kanslergade Agreement in 1933."
 denmark.2.o1:0 "The Nordic Model remains"
 denmark.3.t:0 "New Political Thoughts in [DEN.GetName]"
 denmark.3.d:0 "A number of progressive political parties, ranging from moderate left-wing reformists to environmentally conscious single-issue parties, have experienced a large growth in recent polls. Some political commentators have speculated that the public is tired of the dishonesty and spin prevalent in mainstream politics and is seeking out parties with 'fresh' ideas and ambitions. \n\nWhether this progressive coalition can turn their newfound popularity into actual political influence without sacrificing their integrity remains to be seen."
 denmark.3.o1:0 "It's time for a shake-up"
 denmark.4.t:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] Social Justice on the Rise"
 denmark.4.d:0 "The political discourse in newspapers and blogs is currently witnessing a rising number of issues relating to social justice, with some criticizing the current government for what they view as institutional racism and discrimination of minorities as well as calling for academia to play a larger role in politics. These proponents of social reform seem echoed in the polls that predict an explosive growth to the Danish Social Liberal Party and signal the beginning of social justice as a mainstay in mainstream [DEN.GetAdjective] political discourse."
 denmark.4.o1:0 "Who's triggered now?"
 denmark.5.t:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] Liberals Criticize the Welfare State"
 denmark.5.d:0 "Earlier this week [DEN.GetAdjective] society was shocked to hear the Liberal party openly call for the dismantling of the [DEN.GetAdjective] welfare state in favor of a 'minimal state'. The Liberals seem poised to take the lead and become the largest political party on the right, if not overall, and though in reality this will most likely merely mean cuts to the funding of the welfare state, rather than outright dismantlement, it is being viewed as a minarchist declaration of war on the Nordic Model."
 denmark.5.o1:0 "Let fall what cannot stand"
 denmark.6.t:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] People's Party Gains in Polls"
 denmark.6.d:0 "Recent political developments have seen a greater focus on preserving [DEN.GetAdjective] culture from foreign influences. As for what this constitutes many Danes seem to be of the opinion that [DEN.GetAdjective] culture first and foremost involves pride in the history of [DEN.GetName] and call for relentless progressivism, cultural relativism and globalism to be stopped in favor of a more reactionary return to the doctrine of 'Denmark First'. This development has been good news for the [DEN.GetAdjective] People's Party who many view as the protectors of traditionalism and national pride in [DEN.GetName]."
 denmark.6.o1:0 "Give us back Denmark"
 denmark.7.t:0 "Major Victory Predicted for [DEN.GetAdjective] Conservatives"
 denmark.7.d:0 "The [DEN.GetAdjective] Conservatives seem to have made a triumphant comeback after having been in decline since the beginning of the 90's. When asked about the reason for this turn of events, one political commentator remarked that the international cultural exchanges of the new millennium seems to have left many Danes adrift without a sense of belonging anywhere and have made Danish values a centrepoint of political discourse. Conservative leadership is already gearing up to capitalize on this newfound support with speeches underlining their unwavering defense of 'all that makes us [DEN.GetAdjective]'."

 denmark.8.t:0 "Surprising Monarchist Developments in [DEN.GetName]"
 denmark.8.d:0 "[DEN.GetName] has been a constitutional monarchy since 1849 and the role of the monarch has ever since then been largely ceremonial in nature. However, a new monarchist movement calling for a larger degree of political autonomy for the [DEN.GetAdjective] monarch is rapidly gaining traction in the public. So far the Queen herself has not made any public comments on the matter, but political commentators have pointed out that with her educational background, having studied political science and a variety of academic fields at Sorbonne and the London School of Economics, she would theoretically be a competent actor on the political stage."
 denmark.8.o1:0 "Oh Daisy!"
 denmark.9.t:0 "Martial Law Declared in [DEN.GetName]!"
 denmark.9.d:0 "After a number of large-scale demonstrations for radical changes in [DEN.GetAdjective] politics lately, the situation has now developed into full-scale rioting across the country, forcing [DEN.GetLeader] to declare martial law in order to expand the capacity of the police and military to keep order.\n\nMost of Europe looks on in disbelief as their small northern neighbour is engulfed in civil war, and wonder who will come out on top. Regardless of who wins, large-scale changes are a certainty at this point."
 denmark.9.o1:0 "Send in the troops!"
 denmark.10.t:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] People Rally to Dannebrog"
 denmark.10.d:0 "The recently-declared martial law did not deter the extreme left and a coalition of other opportunists from attempting to overthrow the government of [DEN.GetLeader], but these attempts were resoundingly defeated as the population at large rallied to patriotic militias and fought back against the attempted coup.\n\nThough the government survived, the battle has exposed [DEN.GetLeader] as a weak leader beholden to the extreme right and rumors are that the different groupings of nationalist and fascist leaning are currently negotiating about establishing a new government."
 denmark.10.o1:0 "The symbol of our victory"
 denmark.11.t:0 "Extreme [DEN.GetAdjective] Nationalists Seeking Influence"
 denmark.11.d:0 "It seems the patriotic groups on the extreme right have been able to put their ideological differences aside and formed a united front for [DEN.GetAdjective] nationalists. These usually disparate groups have been united in a common belief in the superiority of the nation of [DEN.GetName] to all other nations in the world, and a strong belief that the new [DEN.GetName] should right the many wrongs that the world has inflicted on the nation throughout the [DEN.GetAdjective] history.\n\nThe rhetoric of these groups are already cause for concern for several of the neighbours of [DEN.GetName], who, historically, the [DEN.GetAdjective] have plenty of reasons to carry a grudge against."
 denmark.11.o1:0 "Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes angulus ridet"
 denmark.12.t:0 "The Rise of [DEN.GetAdjective] Fascism"
 denmark.12.d:0 "It seems that the nationalist groups on the extreme right have acquiesced and been incorporated into the National Socialist Movement of Denmark. This marks a surprising move for the, formerly very small and obscure, movement of Danish nazis, who are now experiencing a rapid growth in members. Some political commentators have remarked that if this development continues we might see the strongest presence of fascism in Denmark since Frits Clausen led the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark during the Occupation in the 1940's."
 denmark.12.o1:0 "[DEN.GetName] for the [DEN.GetAdjective]!"
 denmark.13.t:0 "The [DEN.GetAdjective] Government Toppled by Extreme Internationalists!"
 denmark.13.d:0 "The recently-declared martial law only seemed to have invigorated the internationalist forces seeking to overthrow the corrupt government of [DEN.GetName] and throughout the conflict multiple clashes were reported between the revolutionary internationalists forces and a counter-revolutionary variety of self-declared patriots. Today the internationalists stand as the undisputed victors and the current government of [DEN.GetLeader] has already announced that it will continue only as a temporary transitional government pending the demands of the victors."
 denmark.13.o1:0 "Imagine there's no countries - it's easy if you try"
 denmark.14.t:0 "Radical Islamism Wins Power-Struggle in [DEN.GetName]!"
 denmark.14.d:0 "The coalition of internationalists behind the recent victory in Denmark is now starting to fall apart as questions erupt over the place of religion in the new [DEN.GetName]. As it turns out, a large number of coalition members were fighting for religion rather than against it and at a recent meetingin the Revolutionary Committee arguments were made about islamism as a revolutionary ideology. To the surprise of many, the hardliner left-wingers were outnumbered and the meeting concluded with the expulsion of the self-declared atheists. It seems the internationalist movement has now for all intents and purposes become an islamist movement."
 denmark.14.o1:0 "God is Great!"
 denmark.15.t:0 "[DEN.GetAdjective] Queen Margrethe II Forced to Abdicate!"
 denmark.15.d:0 "After the recent chaos left the internationalist coalition as a major political player in [DEN.GetName] many had wondered for how long the outspokenly anti-royalist coalition would tolerate the [DEN.GetAdjective] monarchy. The answer became known today as Queen Margrethe II announced that she will be abdicating the throne and moving with her family to Great Britain where the British monarch has already offered the royal family permanent residence at Windsor Castle. The Danish throne is now due to be abolished. Political commentators believe that the transition to a republic will be relatively easy due to the former queen not having any political power in the first place."
 denmark.15.o1:0 "Think of all the money we'll save!"
 denmark.16.t:0 "Violent Revolution Averted in [DEN.GetName]"
 denmark.16.d:0 "With the recent abolition of the [DEN.GetAdjective] monarchy and other revolutionary measures, many were worried when the Revolutionary Committee ended up in bitter infighting. Among the most widespread worry was that this would culminate in a bloody revolutionary purge similar to those of the early years of the Soviet Union. This fear seems to have been averted as it turns out that the forces of democratic socialism have won the internal power struggle and have assumed the mantle of the revolution arguing that freedom cannot come to the people through undemocratic means. Political commentators are describing this as a "bloodless revolution" as the battered country collectively draws a sigh of relief."
 denmark.16.o1:0 "It seems the people have a lot more to lose than just their chains"
 denmark.17.t:0 "Revolution in [DEN.GetName]!"
 denmark.17.d:0 "The large amount of revolutionary actions undertaken recently in [DEN.GetName] have already led to huge changes in the country, but activities recently grinded to a halt as member of the Revolutionary Committee disagreed on the means with which to usher in the Revolution. Today it is clear that the hardliners calling for armed insurrection won and reports are already coming in of violent assaults on bankers and politicians in Copenhagen. Meanwhile the moderate voices in the Revolutionary Committee are reported missing, rumoured to be either dead or in hiding. One political commentator bitterly remarked that it seems the revolution is destined to be a bloody one and only time will tell whether it will be worth it in the end."
 denmark.17.o1:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"
