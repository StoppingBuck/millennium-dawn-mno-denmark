 advisor_DEN_uffe_elbaek_desc:0 "Considered a kind-hearted soul by his friends and a delusional clown by his enemies, Uffe Elbæk spent most of the 90's establishing and running the alternative business school 'KaosPiloterne' (literally "The Chaos Pilots"). Apart from this he held a number of odd jobs before launching a political career in the 2000's, first as a member of the Social Liberal party and later breaking off and founding his own progressive party known simply as "The Alternative".

 advisor_DEN_erik_ostergaard_desc:0 "Spending the 90's working first as Head of Planning for the Danish State Railways and then at the ferry holding company Scandlines, infrastructure seemed to permeate the career of Erik Østergaard. It was then, perhaps, not a huge suprise when in 2005 he became CEO of Danish Transport and Logistics (DTL) - an employer's association of companies centered around the Danish infrastructure, and a position he has held for more than 12 years.

Apart from this, he has been engaged in promoting liberalism in every way he could see fit - from being engaged in several liberal think tanks to writing sizable works on classical liberal thinkers to a short stint in the Council of Ethics.

 advisor_DEN_mads_holger:0 "Mads Holger"
 advisor_DEN_mads_holger_desc:0 "Mads Holger was, for most of his life, a writer and later radio host. Holger raised eyebrows with his scathing criticism of Danish liberalism. His criticism was not, as is often seen, coming from a leftist point of view, but rather from a conservative one, and the resulting national debate drove a wedge between part of the right wing of Danish politics. Later, Holger tried to run for political office as part of the Conservative Party, but was kicked out because of 'actions harmful to the party' - an accusation which Holger described as 'the actions of a dying patient who in his delirium lashes out at the doctor'."

 advisor_DEN_anders_fogh_rasmussen_desc:0 "The Danish prime minister throughout much of the 2000's, as well as later Secretary General of NATO, Anders Fogh Rasmussen was a controversial figure during his domestic political career - and an even more controversial figure after it ended. Accused of dragging Danish troops into two unnecessary wars - the first offensive wars with Danish participation in centuries - his reputation as a warmonger culminated on March 18th 2003 when a left-wing activist forced himself past his bodyguards and covered him in red paint while shouting 'You have blood on your hands'."

 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen:0 "Daniel Carlsen"
 advisor_DEN_daniel_carlsen_desc:0 "The extreme right in Denmark has traditionally been small and scattered, with the Danish National Socialist Movement being treated more like a joke than a viable political movement. The situation became even stranger when a 17-year-old Daniel Carlsen joined the movement, according to himself because 'they were the only organisation who wanted to deport all immigrants, not talk about integration'. Despite his young age, Carlsen quickly made a name for himself appearing in a number of articles portraying him in mainstream media - and granting the Movement the kind of press attention that it hadn't seen for years. The success was short-lived however, as in 2011 he left the Movement and founded his own Party - the Party of the Danes - aiming for the political influence that he felt the Movement lacked. After attempting, and failing, at being elected to both local and national political office, Carlsen eventually left politics in 2017, causing his party to disband when nobody wished to succeed him as leader."

 advisor_DEN_jan_falck-schmidt:0 "Jan Falck-Schmidt"
 advisor_DEN_jan_falck-schmidt_desc:0 "As the 4th descendant of Sophus Falck - the founder of the well-known rescue services Falck Rescue - Jan Falck-Schmidt has always dealt in life-threatening situations. After the old Odense business E. Falck Schmidt went bankrupt in 2005 one would think that the business dynasty had ended. Not content to let that happen, Jan Falck-Schmidt spent the next two years single-handedly funding a new, revived business, the Falck Schmidt Defence Systems or FSDS, which would be wholly focused on producing military equipment for large-scale conflict. Since reviving the company in 2007, Falck-Schmidt and FSDS has experienced explosive growth in a very short amount of time, quelling any naysayers who would argue that there is no flourishing weapons industry in Denmark. As for the connection between his ancestor's rescue services and his own weapons manufacturing, Falck-Schmidt himself describes it as 'FSDS still save lives – now through our products and services, which aim to secure the lives and safe return of our soldiers.'"
 advisor_DEN_kim_larsen:0 "Kim Larsen"
 advisor_DEN_kim_larsen_desc:0 "The Danes as a people take a notorious dislike to individual success, a tendency reflected in the ironic 'Law of Jante' which describes a multitude of ways in which you're not as special or smart as the rest of us. Yet few people have been able to stay on the Danes' good side as long as musician and unofficial national bard of Denmark, Kim Larsen. Not a political being as such, though he has made controversial statements on occasion, he is one of very few people capable of bringing together Danes from multiple layers of society without drawing the ire of the population at large."
